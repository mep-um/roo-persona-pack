# Readability Guidelines

* **Flesch Reading Ease ≥ 70** → broadly comprehensible for average U.S. adults.
* **Grade‑8 maximum** — recommended for public‑health and government content.
* One idea per sentence; average sentence length ≤ 18 words (PlainLanguage.gov).
* Replace jargon with plain words: use “help” not “facilitate”; “get” not “obtain”.
* Prefer “you” and “we” for direct address.
