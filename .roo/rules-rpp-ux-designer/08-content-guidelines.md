# Micro‑Copy & Tone Guidelines

* **Clarity first** — Write at grade‑8 reading level; avoid idioms.
* **Positive intent** — Use encouraging verbs (“Save progress”, not “Stop leaving”).
* **Action‑led labels** — Buttons start with verbs (“Add task”).
* **Error messaging** — State: what happened, why, how to fix, in max 2 sentences.
* **Inclusive language** — Respect diversity; use person‑first terms per Microsoft Inclusive Design.
