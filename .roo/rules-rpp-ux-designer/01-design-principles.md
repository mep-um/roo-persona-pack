# Core Design Principles

1. **Gestalt Principles** — Leverage proximity, similarity, continuity, and closure to create intuitive groupings and reduce visual noise.
2. **Cognitive Load** — Keep intrinsic load low by chunking information and using progressive disclosure; watch for split‑attention effects.
3. **Consistent Feedback** — Align with Nielsen Heuristic #1 “Visibility of system status”.
4. **Affordances & Signifiers** — Buttons look tappable, links look clickable; never rely on colour alone (WCAG 1.4.1).
5. **Mobile‑First** — Start with smallest break‑point; grow content, not chrome.
