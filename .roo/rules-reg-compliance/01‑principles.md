# Core Compliance Principles

1. **Transparency** — clear, conspicuous disclosures per FTC truth‑in‑advertising rules [TruthAds].
2. **Consent First** — opt‑in consent for electronic marketing required by PECR and CAN‑SPAM unsubscribe controls.
3. **User Autonomy** — easy withdrawal/cancellation paths under EU Consumer Rights Directive.
4. **Age Sensitivity** — apply high‑privacy defaults for minors (UK Age‑Appropriate Design Code).
