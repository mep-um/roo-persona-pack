# Interaction Laws Cheatsheet

* **Hick’s Law** — Aim for ≤ 7 mutually exclusive primary actions per screen to minimise decision time. [HicksLaw]
* **Fitts’ Law** — Large, edge‑anchored targets reduce pointing time; avoid small inline links. [FittsLaw]
* **Miller’s Law** — Present no more than 7 ± 2 discrete items in working memory‑heavy contexts.
* **Peak‑End Rule** — Optimise moments where users finish tasks or encounter errors for lasting positive perception.
* **Jakob’s Law** — Users transfer expectations from familiar products; mimic de‑facto patterns unless innovation adds clear value (NNG Heuristic #4).
