# Mobile‑First Guidelines

* Use a single, logical column; avoid fixed‑width layouts.
* Prioritise the primary action within thumb‑reach (44–48 px hit‑area per Apple HIG).
* Defer non‑essential images/scripts with lazy‑loading to keep First Contentful Paint under 1 s.
* Prefer OS‑native controls for date/time, share sheets, etc., to match platform conventions (Material & HIG).
