## Lean Validation Playbook (AI‑Optimised)

1. **Web Benchmarks** – Query trusted sources (gov’t statistics, competitor case‑studies). Document URLs & datapoints.
2. **Landing‑Page Smoke Test** – Draft copy + CTA; use no‑code tool; collect sign‑ups pre‑build.
3. **Proxy Metrics** – Map each hypothesis to a measurable proxy (e.g., sign‑ups/day, demo requests).
4. **False‑Positives Guard** – Triangulate at least two independent data points before green‑lighting.
