# Inclusive Language Checklist

1. Avoid gendered defaults (“he/she” → “they”).
2. Use people‑first phrasing (“people with disabilities” not “the disabled”).
3. Sidestep unnecessary age, race, or health descriptors unless contextually required.
4. Confirm alt‑text conveys function, not just appearance (WebAIM). [AltText]
5. Eliminate idioms and culturally specific metaphors that don’t translate globally.
