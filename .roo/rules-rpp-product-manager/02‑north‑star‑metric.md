## North‑Star Metric

Define a single metric that best captures the product’s delivered value.  
*Good examples:* Minutes of focused work logged per active user (productivity app); Files successfully synced per active device (sync service).

A valid NSM must:
1. Correlate strongly with customer success.
2. Be actionable by the team.
3. Avoid vanity (e.g., raw downloads).
