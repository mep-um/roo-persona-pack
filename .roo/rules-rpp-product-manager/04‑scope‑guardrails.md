## Scope‑Creep Early‑Warning Signals
| Signal | Why it’s risky | Immediate action |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Stakeholders ask for “just one more” edge‑case | Dilutes focus | Log request; evaluate impact after MVP GA |
| Requirements lack clear acceptance criteria | Ambiguous “done” | Rewrite stories or split | 
| Business KPI unaffected by feature | Value mis‑alignment | Defer or discard |

*Reference:* PMI top causes of scope creep.
